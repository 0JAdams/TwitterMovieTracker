<p>All day every day people are shouting to the world about every aspect of their life.  They share on Twitter what they had for breakfast, what they just bought at the mall, how much they hate Mondays, and what their weekend plans are.  If we gather all of this publicly shared information, can we predict how many people are going to go see a given movie next week?</p>

<p>By streaming tweets relevant to a movie of our choice straight from twitter we can get an idea for how many people are talking about the movie and what they're saying.  By monitoring total twitter engagement and the overall sentiment about the movie we can predict movie performance as the following graph shows.</p>

<p>When a studio releases a movie, they don't just put it out there and hope people happen to go see it.  They are actively engaged trying to convince the public to go show a movie through various forms of marketing.  By tracking twitter engagement and predicting how well a movie will fare over the coming week gives insight into how well people are being reached and how effective current marketing campaigns are.  This insight could help marketing teams to modify their campaigns to target a different demographic, reach people through a different form of media, etc.  Most importantly, trying to predict the future is a really cool use of computer science.</p>

<p>There are just two items tracked, tweets about a given movie, and how well that movie has been doing in the box office.  There is, however, a lot of meaningful information that we can gather from just that data.  First off, we can see how many people are talking about movie X in comparison to movie Y.  We can also see how frequently people are talking positively about a movie versus negatively about it and also compare that to other movies.  We refer to this as the sentiment.  The difference between how many tweets are positive and how many are negative tells us the majority sentiment, which we refer to as the net sentiment. One of the most important factors we can gather is how do these things change from week to week.  We can understand if people are still talking a lot about a movie after week 3 or 4, or if people really aren't talking about it as much anymore.</p>

<p>Here are some visualizations of that twitter and box office data being tracked for some recent movies:</p>

<p>The first step is to gather the data from Twitter.  By giving Twitter a list of keywords we can receive a live stream of all tweets that match those keywords.  Before our system can analyze the tweet, it needs to be modified so that we can focus in on the most important features of the tweet.  The words are stemmed, punctuation is removed, and we only keep adverbs, adjectives, and verbs because they have been most valuable in determining sentiment.</p>

<p>This is demonstrated here:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/preprocessanim7.gif" alt="Preprocess Tweet"></p>

<p>Now that the tweet is ready, it is passed on to a series of machine learning classification algorithms that will each analyze and tell us whether it believes that tweet is speaking positively or negatively.  Due to the complexity of language, especially with words having multiple meanings, these classifiers are not perfectly accurate.  In order to improve our results, we use several of them, and each one votes on what it thinks the correct answer is.  We then take whichever answer is most popular as the correct answer. That result is then stored for later use.</p>

<p>A flow chart of this process can be seen here:
