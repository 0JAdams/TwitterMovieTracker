{"name":"Twitter Movie Sentiment Tracker","tagline":"Predict Week to Week Movie Performance Using Sentiment Analysis and Decision Trees","body":"## Can Twitter Data Tell Us How A Movie Will Perform Next Week?\r\nAll day every day people are shouting to the world about every aspect of their life.  They share on Twitter what they had for breakfast, what they just bought at the mall, how much they hate Mondays, and what their weekend plans are.  If we gather all of this publicly shared information, can we predict how many people are going to go see a given movie next week?\r\n\r\nBy streaming tweets relevant to a movie of our choice straight from twitter we can get an idea for how many people are talking about the movie and what they're saying.  By monitoring total twitter engagement and the overall sentiment about the movie we can predict movie performance as the following graph shows.\r\n\r\n![Predict Future Week Box Office](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/animated_prediction5.gif)\r\n\r\n## Why Would We Want To Predict This?\r\nBased on a list of movie keywords, relevant tweets are streamed from twitter.  Those tweets are preprocessed, and then analyzed. A group of classification algorithms rate the sentiment of the tweet and vote whether it has a positive sentiment or a negative sentiment.  This sentiment data is tracked over time and stored.\r\n\r\nEach movie's box office data is pulled from the web as daily earnings and stored as well.\r\n\r\nThese two sets of data are then graphed and compared to evaluate correlation between them.\r\n\r\n![Spectre Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/Spectre_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![Hunger Games Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/The%20Hunger%20Games%20Mockingjay%20%20Part%202_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![The Last Witch Hunter Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/The%20Last%20Witch%20Hunter_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![Martian Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/The%20Martian_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![Star Wars 7 Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/Star%20Wars%20Episode%20VII_figure.png)\r\n\r\n## Why it Does it\r\nThe data is gathered to try and understand how social media sentiment correlates to the reception and performance of a movie.  If a strong or weak correlation can be found it could prove to be valuable knowledge for marketing companies that already work to sway social media sentiment.\r\n\r\n## Machine Learning put to Work\r\n\r\n### Sentiment Analysis\r\n\r\n![Sentiment Analysis Flow Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/sentiment-analysis-flow-chart.png)\r\n\r\n### Preprocess Step:\r\n![Preprocess Tweet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/preprocessanim7.gif)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
