{"name":"Twitter Movie Sentiment Tracker","tagline":"Track Twitter Sentiment For Upcoming Movies","body":"### Intro\r\nThis Twitter Movie Sentiment Tracker is a set of Python scripts for monitoring a stream of tweets in relation to chosen movies.  Those tweets are then classified by their overall sentiment.  Release date and box office data are pulled from boxofficemojo.com (thanks goes to them for that). The data is then graphed and compared to find correlations.\r\n\r\n### What it Does\r\nBased on a list of movie keywords, relevant tweets are streamed from twitter.  Those tweets are preprocessed, and then analyzed. A group of classification algorithms rate the sentiment of the tweet and vote whether it has a positive sentiment or a negative sentiment.  This sentiment data is tracked over time and stored.\r\n\r\nEach movie's box office data is pulled from the web as daily earnings and stored as well.\r\n\r\nThese two sets of data are then graphed and compared to evaluate correlation between them.\r\n\r\n### Why it Does it\r\nThe data is gathered to try and understand how social media sentiment correlates to the reception and performance of a movie.  If a strong or weak correlation can be found it could prove to be valuable knowledge for marketing companies that already work to sway social media sentiment.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
