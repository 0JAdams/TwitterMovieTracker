{"name":"Twitter Movie Sentiment Tracker","tagline":"Predict Week to Week Movie Performance Using Sentiment Analysis and Decision Trees","body":"## Can Twitter Data Tell Us How A Movie Will Perform Next Week?\r\nAll day every day people are shouting to the world about every aspect of their life.  They share on Twitter what they had for breakfast, what they just bought at the mall, how much they hate Mondays, and what their weekend plans are.  If we gather all of this publicly shared information, can we predict how many people are going to go see a given movie next week?\r\n\r\nBy streaming tweets relevant to a movie of our choice straight from twitter we can get an idea for how many people are talking about the movie and what they're saying.  By monitoring total twitter engagement and the overall sentiment about the movie we can predict movie performance as the following graph shows.\r\n\r\n![Predict Future Week Box Office](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/animated_prediction5.gif)\r\n\r\n## Why Would We Want To Predict Next Week's Movie Performance?\r\nWhen a studio releases a movie, they don't just put it out there and hope people happen to go see it.  They are actively engaged trying to convince the public to go show a movie through various forms of marketing.  By tracking twitter engagement and predicting how well a movie will fare over the coming week gives insight into how well people are being reached and how effective current marketing campaigns are.  This insight could help marketing teams to modify their campaigns to target a different demographic, reach people through a different form of media, etc.  Most importantly, trying to predict the future is a really cool use of computer science.\r\n\r\n## Exactly What Kind of Information Is Tracked?\r\nPut most basically, there are just two items tracked, tweets about a given movie, and how well that movie has been doing in the box office.  There is a lot of information that we can gather from that data, though.  First off, we can how many people are talking about movie X in comparison to movie Y.  We can also see how frequently people are talking positively about a movie versus negatively about it and also compare that to other movies.  We refer to this as the sentiment.  The difference between how many tweets are positive and how many are negative tells us the majority sentiment, which we refer to as the net sentiment. One of the most important factors we can gather is how do these things change from week to week.  We can understand if people are still talking a lot about a movie after week 3 or 4, or if people really aren't talking about it as much anymore.\r\n\r\nHere are some visualizations of that twitter and box office data being tracked for some recent movies:\r\n\r\n![Spectre Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/Spectre_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![Hunger Games Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/The%20Hunger%20Games%20Mockingjay%20%20Part%202_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![The Last Witch Hunter Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/The%20Last%20Witch%20Hunter_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![Martian Movie Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/The%20Martian_figure.png)\r\n\r\n![Star Wars 7 Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/Star%20Wars%20Episode%20VII_figure.png)\r\n\r\n## How Is The Data Gathered And Analyzed?\r\nThe data is gathered to try and understand how social media sentiment correlates to the reception and performance of a movie.  If a strong or weak correlation can be found it could prove to be valuable knowledge for marketing companies that already work to sway social media sentiment.\r\n\r\n### Sentiment Analysis\r\n\r\n![Sentiment Analysis Flow Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/sentiment-analysis-flow-chart.png)\r\n\r\n### Preprocess Step:\r\n![Preprocess Tweet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0JAdams/TwitterMovieTracker/gh-pages/images/preprocessanim7.gif)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
